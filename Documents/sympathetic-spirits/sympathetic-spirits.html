    <h1>Sypathetic Spirits: An Examination of Spiritualistic Beliefs and Practices in the Development of American Religion</h1>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>The purpose of this project is to provide a sympathetic view of American spiritualistic beliefs and practices and to establish terms which will help distinguish different spiritulistic ideas. I aim to present different spiritualistic thinkers' ideas about and experiences with the spirit world so that outside observers can better understand how and why people develop these beliefs. I will also provide historical contextualization to elucidate how a diversity of spiritualistic beliefs and experiences developed. Belief in spirits and the spirit world has a deep history in American religion and understanding the history and development of spiritualistic beliefs and practices requires taking the perspectives of believers and practitioners seriously. Examination of these perspectives not only provides unique and inherently interesting cases to examine, but helps us to relate to and better understand people who many of us interact with on a daily basis.</h3>
