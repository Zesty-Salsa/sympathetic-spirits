      <h1>Sympathetic Spirits: An Examination of Spiritualistic Beliefs and Practices in the Development of American
        Religion</h1>

      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>The purpose of this project is to provide a sympathetic view of American spiritualistic beliefs and practices
        and to establish terms which will help distinguish different spiritulistic ideas. I aim to present different
        spiritualistic thinkers' ideas about and experiences with the spirit world so that outside observers can better
        understand how and why people develop these beliefs. I will also provide historical contextualization to
        elucidate how a diversity of spiritualistic beliefs and experiences developed. Belief in spirits and the spirit
        world has a deep history in American religion and understanding the history and development of spiritualistic
        beliefs and practices requires taking the perspectives of believers and practitioners seriously. Examination of
        these perspectives not only provides unique and inherently interesting cases to examine, but helps us to relate
        to and better understand people who many of us interact with on a daily basis.</p>

      <header>What is a Spirit?</header>
      <p>Throughout American history, spirits have generally been thought to be a form of human existence which operate
        in a realm seperate from matter. Emmanuel Swedenborg is often recognized as one of the first thinkers to propose
        the existence of a spirit world, which corresponds to life on earth. For instance, in his work <i>Heaven and
          Hell</i>, Swedenborg recorded his visions of an afterlife in which man and women continue to sleep, wake, eat,
        drink, and go about their daily life in an environment mirroring earthly existence. The notion that human beings
        continue exist in an environment seperate from, yet mirroring material existence after death is charateristic of
        spirit belief. According to the scholar Kenneth D. Pimple, the difference between belief and spirits and belief
        in ghosts is that ghosts have historically been tied to a specific physical location associated with their life
        and death. Spirits on the other hand, exist in a seperate environment, untethered from the material world.</p>

      <p>Recently, scholars such as Catherine Albanese and Erik Seeman have begun to recognize certain religious beliefs
        and practices as "spiritualistic." People with spiritualistic inclinations tend to characterize the afterlife as
        largely reflective of life on earth and often attempt to interact with spirits. The following religions
        are characterized as spiritualistic beliefs and practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Swedenborgianism</li>
        <li>Shakerism</li>
        <li>Spiritualism</li>
      </ul>

      <header>What is Spiritualism?</header>
      <p>Spiritualism is a religion that is composed of a diversity of spiritualistic beliefs and practices which
        emerged in the United States
        in the mid-nineteenth century and which maintained prevelence up until the early twentieth century.
        Spiritualists never established a unified religious institution, but many individuals who identified as
        Spiritualists frequently corresponded and collaborated. What unified
        most Spiritualists is the belief in mediumship, or the idea that particular individuals had an increased
        sensitivity to the spirit world and were capable of communicating with, or facilitating communication with,
        spirits. Many scholars have turned away from characterizing Spiritualism as a unified movement and have instead
        turn toward notable individuals who were the first to establish spiritualistic beliefs and practices outside of
        existing religious groups, such as the Swedenborgians and Shakers. On this page, I will briefly discuss who many
        scholars take to be the "founders" of phenomenal and philosophical Spiritualism, the Fox Sisters and Andrew
        Jackson Davis.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="phenomenal">
      <header>Phenomenal Spiritualism</header>
      <p>Many scholars have taken the Fox Sisters as the start of the Spiritualist "Movement," however I will introduce
        them as some of the first Spiritualist practitioners to popularize phenomenal Spiritualism. The term "phenomenal
        Spiritualism" refers to beliefs and practices which concerned themselves primarily with empirical demonstrations
        of the spirit world through séances, planchettes, and other observable phenomena. The Fox Sisters drew large
        crowds to their home in Hydesville, New York, by claiming to communicate with spirits through producing “spirit
        rappings.” These “rappings” were knocking noises without a detectable source which acted as a code in
        transmitting words and sentences from spirits who were asked questions by the sisters. The Fox sisters quickly
        became well-known in New York, with as
        many as five-hundred people visiting their home at one time in 1849. Following the Fox sisters’ spirit
        communications, Spiritualism quickly spread throughout New York, with the Spiritualist Register reporting as
        many as 240,000 registered Spiritualists in the state prior to the Civil War, totaling 6% of the state’s total
        population. The majority of Spiritualists seem to
        have been more interested in the phenomenal Spiritualism of the Fox sisters than philosophical Spiritualism. As
        Spiritualism spread through the United States, gatherings often revolved around the spectacles of psychical
        phenomena as seen through commodified devices such as the planchette and Ouija board. The commodification of
        phenomenal Spiritualism led skeptics and believers alike to associate Spiritualism with spectacle and
        entertainment. Below is a list of people associated with phenomenal Spiritualism and the popularization of
        Spiritualist spectacles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Fox Sisters</li>
        <li>Mina Crandon</li>
        <li>Arthur Ford</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="philosophical">
      <header>Philosophical Spiritualism</header>
      <p>Recently, many scholars of Spiritualism, such as Sally Morita and Robert Delp, have distinguished philosophical
        Spiritualism from phenomenal Spiritualism. Philosophical Spiritualists tended to be more interested in visionary
        experiences, the cosmology of the spirit world, and social reform than phenomenal Spiritualists, who were more
        interested in reproducing empirical evidence of the spirit world. Andrew Jackson Davis was one of the first
        Spiritualists to make this distinction, and frequently criticized "phenomenal Spiritualists" for their
        skepticism and need to seek empirical evidence of the afterlife. In his <i>Great Harmonia</i>, Davis wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Many investigators of Phenomenal Spiritualism may have been, and doubtlessly are, <i>illogical</i> in
        their thoughts; therefore, also, in their actions and character. The cold, repulsive skeptic of last year is our
        unbridled fanatic of to-day; simply because his mind is fevered with the blazing propensities of this immortal
        treasure of future existence.</blockquote>
      <p>Philosophical Spiritualists such as Davis were not overly concerned with phenomenal “proofs” of
        Spiritualism such as spirit photographs, ectoplasm, or spirit channeling because they did not believe that it
        was
        necessary to provide evidence of the afterlife. Instead. philosophical Spiritualists tended to focus on
        subjective
        visionary experiences and historic records of these experiences to inform cosmological and social models.
        However,
        philosophical and phenomological forms of Spiritualism were
        not mutually exclusive. For instance, the Spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle recognized Davis’s philosophy as one
        of
        the most authoritative sources regarding the
        spirit world, while also defending and promoting psychical phenomena. Below are a list of some prominent
        Spiritualists who were particularly interested in philosophical Spiritualism:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Andrew Jackson Davis</li>
        <li>Arthur Conan Doyle</li>
        <li>Emma Hardinge Britten</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Today, scholars such as Catherine Albanese and Erik Seeman reference other spiritualistic or "metaphysical"
        religions as deeply influenced by Spiritualist thinkers. Reformulations of Spiritualist thought made by the
        Theosophical Society, the New Thought movement, and
        Christian Science redirected the idea of a spirit existence across notions of occultism, mind cure, and a
        transformation of the Self. While the Spiritualism itself faded from popularity after the early nineteenth
        century, the same impulses that motivated its shortlived
        popularity went on to inform other religious movements. Understanding how modern spiritual beliefs and practices
        took shape---including divinatory practices, ideas of the afterlife and other worlds, and understandings of the
        self and its continuity---requires tracing these historical geneaology of these cultural developments and
        understanding the specific religious desires they fulfill. </p>
